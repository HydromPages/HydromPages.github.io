The use of cloud technology is one of those outstanding technological advances that have proven to be very useful, but they can also become very restrictive.\nToday, we are going to talk about the cloud compulsion phenomenon and how this affects those who purchase hydrometers that use cloud technology exclusively from a specific operator.\nModern gadgets and devices in the cloud\nCameras, sensors, speakers, hydrometers, pretty much any type of modern device is connected to a cloud operator. The issue with this is that no one is ever going to be able to predict what will happen in the future and a cloud operator could close its doors without warning. This may not have been a common thing to see a few years ago, but the world has turned into a much more volatile and unpredictable place as far as the business landscape goes.\nThe problem with this scenario is that the device that was connected exclusively to that particular cloud service is now completely unable to function. This is the principle of cloud compulsion and it can be a very serious issue that turns your investment on certain hardware choices into a useless pile of expensive paperweights.\nThis is one of the reasons why consumers need to become more aware of this type of issue. It is essential to find ways to ensure that they can purchase gadgets and devices that are not restricted to any specific cloud operator or service. This is something that has translated into a serious loss for those who have relied on a specific cloud service for the connectivity of their hardware.\nSometimes people are quick to jump into contracts with specific cloud service providers and they trust that their services will be available anytime they need them. Unfortunately, due to how volatile the modern world can be, this is not going to be so simple and the sudden disappearance of a cloud operator is not something that seems unlikely.\nHydrom is the ultimate hydrometer solution with no cloud constraints\nThose who seek to own a versatile hydrometer that offers more features and flexibility than all existing competitors are going to find Hydrom to be the perfect choice. The trending IoT approach is to connect devices to specific could services providers and this creates a very limiting situation. This is the main reason why the other options available are not going to be as viable and reliable as Hydrom.\nNumerous cloud services can connect to this hydrometer, but none of them are mandatory for its operation. The use of free protocols such as HTTP/TCP and MQTT are implemented in order to allow the use of this Hydrometer to be as flexible as possible. With so many different cloud systems being able to connect to Hydrom, the longevity of the device is enhanced.\nThe advantages of Hydrom are numerous and it is the only device in existence that combines features such as a calibration wizard, Wlan, Bluetooth, support from several cloud services, web interface for settings, MQTT, HTTP, TCP messages and much more.\nHydrom reaches an even higher level of value thanks to the low energy consumption and the firmware updates that ensure the stability and reliability of the device. It also offers a higher capacity than competitor devices due to the second battery that allows for longer periods of use.\nThis is the kind of product that gives the owner peace of mind regarding how long it will be functional. With such a unique and flexible approach, it is the most solid modern choice available. A truly powerful and highly efficient hydrometer.\nFinal thoughts on the Hydrom Hydrometer\nBeing that we have arrived into a whole new era in the modern world, it is important to be able to purchase items and devices that are going to be useful for as long as possible. This is going to be essential for those who seek to get the best results out of their investments.\nWith that in mind, it makes perfect sense to consider the use of the Hydrom hydrometer due to how flexible it is when it comes to how it connects to cloud services.\nCheck out the details on this powerful and innovative hydrometer that has proven to be one-step ahead of the existing competition!"))}d.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
