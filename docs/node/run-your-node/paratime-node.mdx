# ParaTime Node

:::info

These instructions are for setting up a _ParaTime_ node which participates in one or more ParaTime compute committees. If you want to run a _ParaTime client_ node instead, see the [instructions for running a ParaTime client node](paratime-client-node.mdx). If you want to run a _validator_ node instead, see the [instructions for running a validator node](validator-node/README.md). Similarly, if you want to run a non-validator node instead, see the [instructions for running a non-validator node](non-validator-node.md).

:::

:::caution

For a production setup, we recommend running the ParaTime compute/storage node separately from the validator node (if you run one).

Running ParaTime and validator nodes as separate Oasis nodes will prevent configuration mistakes and/or (security) issues affecting one node type from affecting the other one.

:::

:::tip

If you are looking for some concrete ParaTimes that you can run, see [the list of ParaTimes and their parameters](../../get-involved/run-node/paratime-node.mdx).

:::

:::tip

Oasis Core refers to ParaTimes as runtimes internally, so all configuration options will have runtime in their name.

:::

This guide will cover setting up your ParaTime compute node for the Oasis Network. This guide assumes some basic knowledge on the use of command line tools.

## Prerequisites

Before following this guide, make sure you've followed the [Prerequisites](prerequisites) and [Run a Non-validator Node](non-validator-node.md) sections and have:

* Oasis Node binary installed and configured on your system.
* The chosen top-level `/node/` working directory prepared. In addition to `etc` and `data` directories, also prepare the following directories:
  * `bin`: This will store binaries needed by Oasis Node for running the ParaTimes.
  * `runtimes`: This will store the ParaTime bundles.

:::tip

Feel free to name your working directory as you wish, e.g. `/srv/oasis/`.

Just make sure to use the correct working directory path in the instructions below.

:::

* Genesis file copied to `/node/etc/genesis.json`.

:::tip

Reading the rest of the [validator node setup instructions](validator-node/README.md) may also be useful.

:::

:::info

To speed up bootstraping your new node, we recommend [copying node's state from your existing node](advanced/copy-state-from-one-node-to-the-other.md) or [syncing it using state sync](advanced/sync-node-using-state-sync.md).

:::

### Stake Requirements

To be able to register as a ParaTime node on the Oasis Network, you need to
have enough tokens staked in your entity's escrow account.

Current minimum staking requirements for a specific ParaTime are listed on the
Contribute to the Network section - [Run a ParaTime Node] page. Should you want
to check the staking requirements for other node roles and registered ParaTimes
manually, use the Oasis CLI tools as described in [Common Staking Info].

Finally, to stake the tokens, use our [Oasis CLI tools]. If everything was set
up correctly, you should see something like below when running [Oasis Node
Stake Account Info] command for your entity's account (this is an example for
the Testnet):

```bash
Balance:
  Total: 0.0 TEST
  Available: 0.0 TEST

Active Delegations to this Account:
  Total: 20000.0 TEST (20000000000000 shares)
  Delegations:
    - From:   oasis1qrwdwxutpyr9d2m84zh55rzcf99aw0hkts7myvv9
      Amount: 20000.0 TEST (20000000000000 shares)

Stake Accumulator:
  Claims:
    - Name: registry.RegisterEntity
      Staking Thresholds:
        - Global: entity
    - Name: registry.RegisterNode.HG5TB3dbY8gtYBBw/R/cHfPaOpe0vT7W1wu/2rtpk/A=
      Staking Thresholds:
        - Global: node-compute
      Staking Thresholds:
        - Global: node-storage

Nonce: 1
```

:::caution

The stake requirements may differ from ParaTime to ParaTime and are subject to
change in the future.

### Register a New Entity or Update Your Entity Registration

If you don't have an entity yet, create a new one by following the [Creating Your Entity](validator-node/README.md#creating-your-entity) instructions.

:::danger

Everything in this section should be done on the `localhost` as there are sensitive items that will be created.

:::

If you will be running the ParaTime on a new Oasis Node, initialize a new node by following the [Initializing a Node](validator-node/README.md#initializing-a-node) instructions.

Then update your entity descriptor by enumerating paths to all your node's descriptors (existing and new ones) in the `--entity.node.descriptor` flag. For example:

```bash
oasis-node registry entity update \
    ... various signer flags ... \
    --entity.node.descriptor /localhost/node1/node_genesis.json,/localhost/node2/node_genesis.json
```

:::info

To confirm all nodes are added to your entity descriptor, run:

```bash
cat <PATH-TO-entity.json>
```

and ensure you see all your nodes' IDs under the `"nodes"` list.

For example:

```bash
{
  "v": 2,
  "id": "QTg+ZjubD/36egwByAIGC6lMVBKgqo7xnZPgHVoIKzc=",
  "nodes": [
    "yT1h8/eN0VInQxn3YKcHxvSgGcsjsTSYmdTLZZMBTWI=",
    "HG5TB3dbY8gtYBBw/R/cHfPaOpe0vT7W1wu/2rtpk/A="
  ]
}
```

:::

Then generate and submit the new/updated entity descriptor via the entity registration transaction by following the [Generating Entity Registration Transaction](validator-node/README.md#generating-entity-registration-transaction) instructions.

:::caution

Make sure your entity descriptor (i.e. `entity.json`) is copied to your online server and saved as `/node/entity/entity.json` to ensure the [node's configuration](paratime-node.mdx#configuration) will find it.

:::

:::tip

You will [configure the node](paratime-node.mdx#configuration) to automatically register for the roles it has enabled (i.e. storage and compute roles) via the `worker.registration.entity` configuration flag.

No manual node registration is necessary.

:::

:::info

ParaTime rewards for running the compute node will be sent to your entity address **inside the ParaTime**. To access the rewards on the consensus layer, you will need to withdraw them first. Read the [Deposit/Withdraw Tokens to/from ParaTime](../../general/manage-tokens/advanced/oasis-cli-tools/deposit-withdraw-tokens-to-from-paratime.mdx) chapter to learn more.

:::

### The ParaTime Bundle

In order to run a ParaTime node you need to obtain the ParaTime bundle that
needs to come from a trusted source. The bundle (usually with an `.orc`
extension that stands for Oasis Runtime Container) contains all the needed
ParaTime binaries together with the identifier and version metadata to ease
deployment.

When the ParaTime is running in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) the bundle
will also contain all the required artifacts (e.g. SGXS version of the binary
and any enclave signatures).

:::danger

Like the genesis document, make sure you obtain these from a trusted source.

:::

:::caution

#### **Compiling the ParaTime Binary from Source Code**

In case you decide to build the ParaTime binary from source yourself, make sure
that you follow our [guidelines for deterministic compilation](../../paratime/reproducibility.md)
to ensure that you receive the exact same binary.

When the ParaTime is running in a TEE, a different binary to what is registered
in the consensus layer will not work and will be rejected by the network.

:::

### Install Oasis Core Runtime Loader

For ParaTimes running inside [Intel SGX Trusted Execution Environment](paratime-node.mdx#setting-up-trusted-execution-environment-tee), you will need to install the Oasis Core Runtime Loader.

The Oasis Core Runtime Loader binary (`oasis-core-runtime-loader`) is part of Oasis Core binary releases, so make sure you download the appropriate version specified the [Network Parameters](../mainnet/README.md) page.

Install it to `bin` subdirectory of your node's working directory, e.g. `/node/bin/oasis-core-runtime-loader`.

### Install ParaTime Bundle

For each ParaTime, you need to obtain its bundle and install it to the
`runtimes` subdirectory of your node's working directory.

:::info

For example, for the [Cipher ParaTime](../mainnet/README.md#cipher-paratime),
you would have to obtain the `cipher-paratime.orc` bundle and install it to
`/node/runtimes/cipher-paratime.orc`.

:::

### Install Bubblewrap Sandbox (at least version 0.3.3)

ParaTime compute nodes execute ParaTime binaries inside a sandboxed environment provided by [Bubblewrap](https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap). In order to install it, please follow these instructions, depending on your distribution:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Ubuntu 18.10+">

```bash
sudo apt install bubblewrap
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Fedora">

```bash
sudo dnf install bubblewrap
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Other Distributions">
On other systems, you can download the latest [source release provided by the Bubblewrap project](https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap/releases) and build it yourself.

Make sure you have the necessary development tools installed on your system and the `libcap` development headers. On Ubuntu, you can install them with:

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential libcap-dev
```

After obtaining the Bubblewrap source tarball, e.g. [bubblewrap-0.4.1.tar.xz](https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap/releases/download/v0.4.1/bubblewrap-0.4.1.tar.xz), run:

```bash
tar -xf bubblewrap-0.4.1.tar.xz
cd bubblewrap-0.4.1
./configure --prefix=/usr
make
sudo make install
```

:::caution

Note that Oasis Node expects Bubblewrap to be installed under `/usr/bin/bwrap` by default.

:::
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Ensure you have a new enough version by running:

```
bwrap --version
```

:::caution

Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (and earlier) provide overly-old `bubblewrap`. Follow _Other Distributions_ section on those systems.

:::

### Setting up Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)

If a ParaTime requires the use of a TEE, then make sure you set up TEE as instructed in the [Set up Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)](prerequisites/set-up-trusted-execution-environment-tee.md) doc.

## Configuration

In order to configure the node create the `/node/etc/config.yml` file with the following content:

```yaml
datadir: /node/data

log:
  level:
    default: info
    tendermint: info
    tendermint/context: error
  format: JSON

genesis:
  file: /node/etc/genesis.json

consensus:
  tendermint:
    core:
      listen_address: tcp://0.0.0.0:26656

      # The external IP that is used when registering this node to the network.
      # NOTE: If you are using the Sentry node setup, this option should be
      # omitted.
      external_address: tcp://{{ external_address }}:26656

    p2p:
      # List of seed nodes to connect to.
      # NOTE: You can add additional seed nodes to this list if you want.
      seed:
        - "{{ seed_node_address }}"

runtime:
  mode: compute
  paths:
    # Paths to ParaTime bundles for all of the supported ParaTimes.
    - "{{ runtime_orc_path }}"

  # The following section is required for ParaTimes which are running inside the
  # Intel SGX Trusted Execution Environment.
  sgx:
    loader: /node/bin/oasis-core-runtime-loader

worker:
  registration:
    # In order for the node to register itself, the entity.json of the entity
    # used to provision the node must be available on the node.
    entity: /node/entity/entity.json

  p2p:
    # External P2P configuration.
    port: 30002
    addresses:
      # The external IP that is used when registering this node to the network.
      - "{{ external_address }}:30002"

# The following section is required for ParaTimes which are running inside the
# Intel SGX Trusted Execution Environment.
ias:
  proxy:
    address:
      # List of IAS proxies to connect to.
      # NOTE: You can add additional IAS proxies to this list if you want.
      - "{{ ias_proxy_address }}"
```

Before using this configuration you should collect the following information to replace the  variables present in the configuration file:

* `{{ external_address }}`: The external IP you used when registering this node.
* `{{ seed_node_address }}`: The seed node address in the form `ID@IP:port`.
  * You can find the current Oasis Seed Node address in the [Network Parameters](../mainnet/README.md).
* `{{ runtime_orc_path }}`: Path to the [ParaTime bundle](paratime-node.mdx#the-paratime-bundle) of the form `/node/runtimes/foo-paratime.orc`.
  * You can find the current Oasis-supported ParaTimes in the [Network Paramers](../mainnet/README.md#paratimes).
* `{{ ias_proxy_address }}`: The IAS proxy address in the form `ID@HOST:port`.
  * You can find the current Oasis IAS proxy address in the [Network Parameters](../mainnet/README.md#cipher-paratime).
  * If you want, you can also [run your own IAS proxy](ias-proxy.md).

:::caution

Make sure the `worker.p2p.port` (default: `9200`) port is exposed and publicly
accessible on the internet (for `TCP` traffic).

:::

## Starting the Oasis Node

You can start the node by running the following command:

```bash
oasis-node --config /node/etc/config.yml
```

## Checking Node Status

To ensure that your node is properly connected with the network, you can run the following command after the node has started:

```bash
oasis-node control status -a unix:/node/data/internal.sock
```

## Troubleshooting

See the general [Node troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) and [Set up TEE troubleshooting](prerequisites/set-up-trusted-execution-environment-tee.md#troubleshooting) sections before proceeding with ParaTime node-specific troubleshooting.

### Too Old Bubblewrap Version

Double check your installed `bubblewrap` version, and ensure is at least of version **0.3.3**. Previous versions of this guide did not explicitly mention the required version. For details see the [Install Bubblewrap Sandbox](paratime-node.mdx#install-bubblewrap-sandbox-at-least-version-0-3-3) section.

### Stake Requirement

Double check your node entity satisfies the staking requirements for a ParaTime node. For details see the [Stake Requirements](paratime-node.mdx#stake-requirements) section.
