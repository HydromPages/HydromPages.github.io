If you have a general question on how to use and deploy our software, please
read our [Run a Node](../node/README.mdx) section or join our
[community Discord](README.md).

All community members are welcome and encouraged to commit code, documentation
and enhancement proposals to the platform. Contribution guidelines can be found

### Governance Model Overview

The Oasis Protocol Foundation proposes a representative democracy governance
model based on a combination of off-chain and on-chain processes for the
continued development of the Oasis Network. The Oasis Protocol Foundation will
be tasked with guiding the long-term development of the platform and
coordinating the community of development and network operations, with input
collected from community members and changes to the network being voted on by
node operators, with voting power based proportionally on staked and delegated
tokens. We propose this model because we think it will provide a balanced voice
to all engaged community members -- from developers of all sizes, to node
owners, to token holders -- while at the same time still facilitating the swift
deployment of network updates, new features, critical bug fixes.

In order for the community to balance distributed ownership and participation
with speed and quality of platform development, we propose a hybrid model of
off- and on-chain mechanisms, organized around the following key components:

1. Minor Feature Requests
2. Major Feature Requests
3. Bug Fixes

### Decision Making Process

Moving forward, our proposed process for reviewing and approving major protocol
updates is:

* **Proposals.** for features and roadmap updates can come from anyone in the
  community in the form of issues
  ([for minor features](network-governance.md#minor-feature-requests)) or
  [Architectural Decision Records](../../adrs) (ADRs,
  [for major features](network-governance.md#major-feature-requests)).
* **Review and discussion of the proposals.** Decisions about the future of the
  project are made through discussion with all members of the community, from 
  the newest user to the most experienced. All non-sensitive project management
  discussion takes place in the Oasis Protocol GitHub via issues
  ([for minor features](network-governance.md#minor-feature-requests)) and ADRs
  ([for major features](network-governance.md#major-feature-requests)).
* **Decision making process.** In order to ensure that the project is not
  bogged down by endless discussion and continual voting, the project operates
  a policy of lazy consensus. This allows the majority of decisions to be made
  without resorting to a formal vote.

  In general, as long as nobody explicitly opposes a proposal or patch, it is
  recognised as having the support of the community. For lazy consensus to be
  effective, it is necessary to allow at least 72 hours before assuming that
  there are no objections to the proposal. This requirement ensures that
  everyone is given enough time to read, digest and respond to the proposal.

  In case consensus is not reached through discussion, the
  [project committers](https://github.com/oasisprotocol/oasis-core/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md#committers)
  may vote to either accept the proposal or reject it. Votes are cast using
  comments in the proposal pull request. The proposal is accepted by a simple
  majority vote.
* **Final vote for approval.** Once built, the community votes to approve each
  upgrade and the corresponding features that are included in the proposal.
  This voting process may initially be done off-chain but will eventually
  become an on-chain process. Entities holding stake will vote to approve
  changes, with each entity's voting power being proportional to their share of
  tokens staked relative to the total tokens staked.
* **Upgrade.** Node operators autonomously upgrade their system to run the new
  version of the software.

### Minor Feature Requests

To request new functionality, there are two primary approaches that will be
most effective at receiving input and making progress.

If the feature is small - a change to a single piece of functionality, or an
addition that can be expressed clearly and succinctly in a few sentences,
then the most appropriate place to
[propose it is as a new feature request](https://github.com/oasisprotocol/oasis-core/issues/new?template=feature_request.md)
in the Oasis Core repository.

### Major Feature Requests

If the feature is more complicated, involves protocol changes, or has potential
safety or performance implications, then consider
[proposing an Architectural Decision Record (ADR)](../../adrs) and submit it as
a pull request to the Oasis Core repository. This will allow a structured
review and commenting of the proposed changes. You should aim to get the ADR
accepted and merged before starting on implementation. Please keep in mind that
the project's committers still have the final word on what is accepted into the
project.

:::info

We recommend that major protocol updates including a need to hard fork, roadmap
and feature planning be conducted with recommendations from the Oasis Protocol
Foundation and its technical advisory committee.

### Urgent Bug Fixes

Urgent bug fixes will primarily be coordinated off-chain to optimize for speed
in addressing any issues that are critical to the immediate health of the
network. The Oasis Network community as a whole is collectively responsible for
identifying and addressing bugs. As bugs are identified, the Oasis Protocol
Foundation can serve as a line of first defense to triage these bugs and
coordinate security patches for quick release.

Bugs are a reality for any software project. We can't fix what we don't know
about!

If you believe a bug report presents a security risk, please follow
[responsible disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure)
and report it by following the
[security disclosure information](https://oasisprotocol.org/security) instead
of filing a public issue or posting it to a public forum.

We will get back to you promptly.

Otherwise, please, first search between
[existing issues in our repository](https://github.com/oasisprotocol/oasis-core/issues)
and if the issue is not reported yet,
[file a new one](https://github.com/oasisprotocol/oasis-core/issues/new?template=bug_report.md).
