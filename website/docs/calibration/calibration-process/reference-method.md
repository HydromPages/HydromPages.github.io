  Reference method is a calibration method that is considered to be very
  accurate. The density of the current liquid is measured and communicated to
  the Hydrom. The hydrometer then calculates the calibr

# Reference method



:::tip
**Precondition:**

1. User interface Access\
   To make this setting you must have access to the user interface. If this is not the case, see here how to do it:[access-to-the-user-interface.md](../../docs/Getting%20Started/establish-first-connection-to-the-hydrom/access-to-the-user-interface.mdx "mention")
2. Equipment needed:
   1. Density verification meter
   2. Reference liquid (can be beer in the brewing process)
:::

1. Place the hydrometer in the reference liquid. Open the reference calibration by clicking on "Navigation"-->"Calibration"--> "Calibration"--> Method.
2. Start the calibration by pressing the green button at the bottom "Start".
3. The first step of the calibration will open.
4. Measure the current density of the reference liquid and enter the measured value in the field provided and acknowledge by pressing "Next" Button.
5. The hydrom now measures the current angle and saves it, then a new window opens.
6. Change the density of the reference liquid (e.g. by waiting in the brewing process) or by adding sugar to a water mixture.
7. Measure the current density of the reference liquid and enter the measured value in the field provided and acknowledge by pressing "Next" Button.
8. The steps are performed a total of 7x
9. The formula is then calculated and the measured values and displayed in the table.
10. Calibration is completed

**IMPORTANT**
Please save the formula that was calculated for the calibration externally. If the hydrometer has to be reset, this formula will also be reset to the original value. There are 2 ways to save the formula:

1. download the Settings.json file  
   [Broken link](broken-reference "mention")
2. note the formula which can be found under "Calibration" --> "Costum Form\
   [manually-change-the-formula.md](manually-change-the-formula.md "mention")
