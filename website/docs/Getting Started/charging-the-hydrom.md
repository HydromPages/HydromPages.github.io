# Charging the Hydrom



The Hydrom can be charged with any commercially available USB-C charging cable.

Even the direction in which you insert the plug into the device does not matter. To charge, open the Hydrom by twisting off the lid.

The charging LED (described here [#2-charging-led](indicator-leds.md#2-charging-led "mention")) indicates the current charging status. If the LED is red, the Hydrom is being charged. When the LED is green, the charging process is complete.\
