<details><summary>If I understand correctly,sending data automatically by interval only works if I put the hydrom in deep sleep in the web interface.</summary>.
That is completely correct what you say.
The hydrom sends the data only when it is in Deep Sleep.
</details>

<details><summary>If I turn the hydrom off and on again at the switch, is it also in Deep Sleep?</summary>.
Exactly right.This will cause a restart and send the readings to the service after the time set
</details>

<details><summary>Short press activates the web interface, long press activates the access point for configuration?</summary>
The first part was correct, the second was not.Long press resets the device.
The hydrom ALWAYS also sets up an access point when the web interface is activated.
</details>

<details><summary>The default address is chosen unfortunate for me, on 192.168.2.1 sits my router</summary>.
That should not matter ;)The address is used exclusively when the device is accessed in access point mode.Then there is no router.
If the device was connected to the WLAN of your router, then the device gets a new address (Specifically for your network) from the DHCP of your router.
