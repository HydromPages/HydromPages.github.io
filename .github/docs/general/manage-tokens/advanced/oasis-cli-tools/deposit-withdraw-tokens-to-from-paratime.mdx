# Deposit/Withdraw Tokens to/from ParaTime

To perform ParaTime deposits or withdrawals using a command line interface, you will need `oasis` executable which is part of the [Oasis CLI](https://github.com/oasisprotocol/oasis-sdk/tree/main/cli). `oasis` is supplemental to `oasis-node` and supports ParaTime-related operations such as deposits, withdrawals, transfers and manipulation of the smart contracts, in contrast to `oasis-node` which only supports consensus layer features.

We will assume that your already have an Oasis wallet with some ROSE and that you want to Deposit or Withdraw ROSE to or from Emerald ParaTime running on the Mainnet network.

:::info

At time of writing, no precompiled `oasis` binaries are available. You will need to clone the [`oasis-sdk` git repository](https://github.com/oasisprotocol/oasis-sdk/) and compile the tool yourself. The process is straight forward - just follow the [Readme](https://github.com/oasisprotocol/oasis-sdk/blob/main/cli/README.md).

:::

:::info

This chapter describes the command line interface for depositing and withdrawing ROSE which is tailored toward advanced users such as node operators. If you are interested in the end-user wallets with a graphical user interface, consult the [How to Transfer ROSE into a ParaTime](../../how-to-transfer-rose-into-paratime.mdx) chapter.

:::

## Import your wallet

To sign any transaction you will need to import an Oasis wallet. Prepare your base64-encoded private key or the BIP39 mnemonic of your Oasis account and run:

```
oasis wallet import <SOME_WALLET_NAME>
```

Follow the interactive instructions that will guide you through the import procedure. If this is the first time you are running `oasis`, the imported wallet will become your default wallet and transactions will be signed with the key stored in this wallet, if not otherwise specified with the `--wallet` parameter.

## Configure Allowance

In order to deposit ROSE to a ParaTime, you will first need to grant the ParaTime access to your Oasis account on the consensus layer. The following command allows Emerald to access up to 100 ROSE stored on your Oasis account which you will deposit afterwards:

```
$ oasis accounts allow paratime:emerald 100
Unlock your wallet.
? Passphrase:
You are about to sign the following transaction:
Method: staking.Allow
Body:
  Beneficiary:   oasis1qqdpkrh0v9jn80kymcvgk57v38x38qwdxvvtnjfm
  Amount change: +10.0 ROSE
Nonce:  5
Fee:
  Amount: 0.0 ROSE
  Gas limit: 0
  (gas price: 0.0 ROSE per gas unit)

Network:  mainnet
Paratime: none (consensus layer)

Transaction hash: a28a67b7af6bdce84760d5d61b982c0e89aa6874dda0aad01b61ef85feea8601
```

The allowance above **adds** the amount of ROSE Emerald ParaTime will be allowed to access. For example, if your run the command above 3 times, Emerald will obtain the permission to access 300 ROSE. Later, each deposit will subtract ROSE from the allowed amount.

:::info

By default the Oasis CLI will execute transactions on Emerald ParaTime deployed on the Mainnet. You can always use another ParaTime and the network by using the `--paratime` and `--network` parameters respectively.

:::

## Deposit

After setting up the allowance policy, we can execute the deposit transaction. The following command will deposit 100 ROSE from your consensus account to your ParaTime account.

```
$ oasis accounts deposit 100 --gas-price 0
Unlock your wallet.
? Passphrase:

    ],

```

Currently, deposit transactions are free of charge, so we can avoid spending ROSE for the gas fee by adding the `--gas-price 0` parameter. Also, keep in mind that **deposit and withdrawal fees are always paid by your ParaTime account.** If it doesn't contain any ROSE, you are not able to cover the fees.

To deposit ROSE to a different ParaTime account, simply add the bech32-encoded `oasis1` address to the deposit command:

```
$ oasis accounts deposit 100 oasis1qpxhsf7xnm007csw2acaa7mta2krzpwex5c90qu6 --gas-price 0
Unlock your wallet.

Also, Ethereum hex-encoded addresses are supported which are common in Emerald ParaTime:

Withdraw transactions are not free of charge and the fee will be deducted **from your ParaTime balance**.

You can specify a custom Oasis address which you want to withdraw your ROSE to by appending it to the withdraw command:

```
$ oasis accounts withdraw 100 oasis1qpxhsf7xnm007csw2acaa7mta2krzpwex5c90qu6
