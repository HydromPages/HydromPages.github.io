# Getting Started

## Use Oasis

These guides provide general overview of the Oasis Network and introduce basic
tools for you to get started.

<DocCardList items={[
    findSidebarItem('/general/oasis-network/'),
    findSidebarItem('/general/manage-tokens/'),
]} />

## Get Involved

Contains information on official channels to get in touch with the Oasis Network
developers and how to contribute to the network.

<DocCardList items={[
    findSidebarItem('/get-involved/'),
    findSidebarItem('https://oasisrose.garden'),
    findSidebarItem('/get-involved/run-node'),
    findSidebarItem('/get-involved/oasis-core'),
]} />

## Run your own Node

If you want to run your own Oasis node, the following section will provide you
with guides on the current Mainnet and Testnet network parameters and how to
set up your node, let it be a validator node, perhaps running a ParaTime or
just a simple client node for your server to submit transactions and perform
queries on the network.

<DocCardList items={[
    findSidebarItem('/node/'),
    findSidebarItem('/node/mainnet/'),
    findSidebarItem('/node/testnet/'),
    findSidebarItem('/node/run-your-node'),
]} />

## DApps and ParaTime Developers

These two sections are focused on developers building applications on top of
the Oasis Network. Smart contract developers will be interested in the
EVM-compatible Emerald and confidential Sapphire ParaTimes. For maximum
security and confidentiality, the Oasis team designed a novel Cipher ParaTime
executing Wasm smart contracts and which allows you to develop smart contracts
in Rust using the Oasis Contract SDK. Finally, developers can learn how to
build their own ParaTime running on the Oasis Network.

<DocCardList items={[
    findSidebarItem('/dapp/emerald/'),
    findSidebarItem('/dapp/sapphire/'),
    findSidebarItem('/dapp/cipher/'),
    findSidebarItem('/paratime/'),
]} />

## Oasis Core Contributors

Whether you want to contribute your code to the core components of the Oasis
Network or just learn more about the Oasis core, this is the place for you.
