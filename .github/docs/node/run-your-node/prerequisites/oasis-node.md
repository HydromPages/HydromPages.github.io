# Install Oasis Node Binary

The Oasis Node is a binary that is created from the [Oasis Core](https://github.com/oasisprotocol/oasis-core) repository's `go/` path.

It contains both the logic for running an Oasis node and also provides a CLI for handling registry, staking and other operations.

:::caution

The Oasis Node is currently only supported on x86_64 Linux systems.

## Downloading a Binary Release

:::tip

We suggest that you build Oasis Node from source yourself for a production deployment of an Oasis node.

:::

For convenience, we provide binaries that have been built by the Oasis Protocol Foundation. Links to the binaries are provided in the [Network Parameters](../../mainnet/README.md) page.

## Building From Source

Although highly suggested, building from source is currently beyond the scope of this documentation.

See [Oasis Core's Build Environment Setup and Building](../../../core/development-setup/build-environment-setup-and-building) documentation for more details.

:::danger

The code in the [`master` branch](https://github.com/oasisprotocol/oasis-core/tree/master/) might be incompatible with the code used by other nodes in the Mainnet.

Make sure to use the version specified in the [Network Parameters](../../mainnet/README.md).

:::

## Adding `oasis-node` Binary to `PATH`

To install the `oasis-node` binary for the current user, copy/symlink it to `~/.local/bin`.

To install the `oasis-node` binary for all users of the system, copy it to `/usr/local/bin`.

## Running ParaTimes

If you intend to [run a ParaTime node](../paratime-node.mdx) you will need to additionally install the following software packages:

* [Bubblewrap](https://github.com/projectatomic/bubblewrap) 0.4.1+, needed for creating process sandboxes.



  On Ubuntu 20.04+, you can install it with:

  ```text
  sudo apt install bubblewrap
  ```

  On Fedora, you can install it with:

  ```text
  sudo dnf install bubblewrap
  ```
