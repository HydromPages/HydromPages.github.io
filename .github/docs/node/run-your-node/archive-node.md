# Archive Node

:::info

Archive node support is currently only available in the [21.3.14](
https://github.com/oasisprotocol/oasis-core/releases/tag/v21.3.14) release for
use with the Cobalt (pre Damask upgrade) archived state.

:::

This guide will cover setting up an archive node for the Oasis Network. Node
started in archive mode only serves existing consensus and runtime states.
The node has all unneeded consensus and P2P functionality disabled, therefore
it will not participate in the network. Archive nodes can be used to access
historic state which is pruned in dump-restore network upgrades.

## Prerequisites

Archive node requires a pre-existing oasis-node state.

## Configuration

Archive mode can be enabled by using the `consensus.tendermint.mode` setting.

:::info

This will configure the given node to act as a consensus archive node.

:::

```yaml
# other settings omitted ...
consensus:
  tendermint:
    mode: archive
```

:::info

Keep other settings unchanged from the full-node. For example in order to
serve archived runtime state, the node needs to have the runtime configured
and have the state present.

:::

## Starting the Oasis Node

You can start the node by running the following command:

```bash
oasis-node --config /node/etc/config.yml
```

### Archive node status

To ensure the node is running in archive mode, run the following command:

```bash
oasis-node control status -a unix:/node/data/internal.sock
```

Output should report `archive` consensus mode status:

```json
{
  // other fields omitted ...
  "consensus": {
    "mode": "archive",
}
```
